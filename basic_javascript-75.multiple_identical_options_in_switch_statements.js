//If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

function sequentialSizes(val) {
  var answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
      return "Low";
      break;
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      return "Mid";
      break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
      return "High";
      break;
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

// Change this value to test
sequentialSizes(1);
